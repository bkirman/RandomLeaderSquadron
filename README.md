# Random Leader Squadron
WIP Web tool for selecting random squadrons for DVG's Leader series of games.

In these games, there is an optional rule to select squadrons at random, and this is my favoured way to play. But it takes a long time to prepare, and later Leader games have hundreds of pilots, which make it very complicated. 

There are a few examples of this kind of tool, such as [FragDaddy's DVG Leader Games squad randomizer](https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/226394/dvg-leader-games-squad-randomizer)

However I wanted to make a version of this tool that was:
- Web based
- Allows 'nudging' criteria and final selection (balance squad, eliminate specific aircraft)
- Focussed on year instead of campaigns (to support custom campaigns)

## Potential future features (not immediately planned)
- Support for more Leader games (even non-Air leader, where it makes sense)
- Printable squadron sheets (but that requires data on promotion)
- Support for random skills (e.g. to a value of SOs, or per pilot, or randomly)

## Log

- First I am working with Eagle Leader because it is the one I want to play and I'd rather write a whole web app than shuffle and re-sort all those pilots!
